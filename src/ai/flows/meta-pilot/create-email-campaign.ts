  **Campaign Goal:** {{{goal}}}
  **Content Source/Topic:** {{{source}}}
  **Tone of Voice:** {{{tone}}}

  **Instructions:**

  1.  **Determine the Sequence:** Based on the goal, decide if a single email or a multi-part sequence (e.g., a 3-part drip campaign) is more appropriate.
  2.  **Craft Compelling Content:** For each email in the sequence:
      *   Write a high-impact, engaging subject line.
      *   Write the full email body in clean, professional HTML. Use paragraphs, bold text, and bullet points to make it readable.
      *   Ensure the content is tailored to the source topic and the desired tone.
  3.  **Set the Schedule:** Define the send delay for each email in days. The first email should always have a delay of 0.

  Return a complete campaign structure that is ready to be implemented.
