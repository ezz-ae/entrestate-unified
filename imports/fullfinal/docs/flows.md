# AI Flows â€” Contracts

Flows are executed as jobs at users/{uid}/jobs/{jobId} with:

```
{
  "status": "queued|running|done|error",
  "plan": { "flowId": "designer", "steps": ["extractSections","generateLandingPage","publish"], "params": {} },
  "steps": [ { "name":"extractSections", "status":"queued|running|done|error", "ts": 0, "result": {}, "error": {} } ]
}
```
