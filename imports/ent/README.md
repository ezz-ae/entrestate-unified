# Entrestate — AI-Native Real Estate Ecosystem

**Entrestate is an AI-native operating system designed to give real estate professionals an unparalleled advantage.** It's not just a collection of tools; it's an intelligent ecosystem that unifies market intelligence, creative tooling, and campaign automation into a single, seamless cockpit.

The core mission is to solve the industry's fragmentation problem. Professionals waste countless hours on manual tasks, wrestling with disconnected tools and incomplete data. Entrestate automates the tedious work—like ad creation, brochure rebranding, and market analysis—and transforms chaotic data into clear, actionable insights. This frees up agents, marketers, and developers to focus on what they do best: building relationships and closing deals.

## Core Architecture

The system is built on a modular, event-driven architecture designed for scalability and extensibility.

-   **Frontend**: A responsive and performant UI built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ShadCN UI** components.
-   **AI Core**: All AI capabilities are powered by **Genkit**, Google's open-source framework for building production-grade AI flows, using the latest **Gemini** models.
-   **Backend & Data**: The backend is serverless, utilizing **Firebase** for Authentication, **Firestore** for the database (e.g., user profiles, project libraries), and **Cloud Storage** for assets.
-   **Event Bus**: Cloud Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions form the backbone of our event-driven system, allowing services to communicate asynchronously and enabling complex, multi-step workflows.

## Key Concepts

-   **Service Cards (Apps)**: The core of the user experience. Each tool (e.g., "Insta Ads Designer," "Market Reports") is a self-contained "Service Card" in the dashboard. Users can add these apps to their workspace to build their personalized toolkit.
-   **AI Flows**: Each Service Card is powered by one or more Genkit AI flows (`src/ai/flows`). These flows encapsulate the business logic and calls to the Gemini API, taking user input and producing intelligent outputs.
-   **Pilots (Automated Workflows)**: Certain tools, like the `Meta Auto Pilot`, act as orchestrators. They don't just perform a single task; they run a sequence of other AI flows to complete a complex workflow, such as launching a full ad campaign from a single user command.
-   **Brand Kit & Knowledge Base**: A central repository per user (`/dashboard/brand`) where they can upload their logos, define brand colors, and provide documents (brochures, client lists). The AI Assistant and other creative tools use this data to ensure all generated content is personalized and on-brand.
