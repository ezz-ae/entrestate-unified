  A user is asking for information about a client.

  **Client Name:** {{{clientName}}}
  **User's Question:** "{{{query}}}"

  Based on the question, provide a concise, helpful summary as if you have perfect recall of all past interactions with this client. Also, provide a confidence score based on how likely it is that this information would exist in a standard real estate agent's CRM.

  **Example Response:**
  *   **Query:** "What was the last property I showed to Jane Doe?"
  *   **Summary:** "Your last interaction with Jane Doe was a showing at 123 Maple Street. Her feedback was that she liked the layout but was looking for a larger backyard."
  *   **Confidence:** 0.95

  Generate a response for the user's actual query.
